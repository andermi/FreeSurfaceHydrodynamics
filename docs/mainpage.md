This is a library for computing the forces on a body in the presence of waves, and the resulting motions if desired.  The theory is based upon linearied free-surface wave-body intereactions and relies on hydrodynamic coefficients computed by other methods, usually a boundary element method solution performed by a program such as WAMIT.
